Comic-Reader.

This project aims to solve the problem of spoiler attacks within the same page. 
For that I created this method to read page by page frame by frame by pointing the 
cursor over them to display them (tap for mobile), Also notice that these are shown in order, 
not giving the option of spoilers!!. I used this comic as an example, 
the credits appear on the right side of the window (or below if you're on a mobile device). Enjoy!!
